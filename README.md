# Counter Strike:Global Offensive Stats 
A simple and cool program to look up your Counter Strike:Global Offensive game stats from the Steam API. 
From this data, basic statistics are selected and graphs are created. 
The main.json file contains my statistics from the game. To preview the results of the programme, there is a .png file with an image of the graphs and a .csv file in the project.
